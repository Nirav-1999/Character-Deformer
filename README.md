# Character-Deformer
This is an application that simulates character deformation by taking as input an object mesh and provides deformation handles.
I have Implemented IK algorithms like Tikhonov, Pseudo-Inverse and Jacobian Transpose method and Also programmed the forward
kinematics part along with dual quaternion skinning for better simulation of deformations in C++ with OpenGL.
